### Hi, I'm Henley ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a professional developer based in Manchester, UK.

##### My main experience is with HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, React, Node, C#, Java, T-SQL. I am focusing on levelling up my HTML, CSS, JS and React at the moment before moving in to more depth with MongoDB, Node and Express to be a solid MERN dev.

##### If you're looking for a hand with coding then fire me a message as I'm open to mentoring.
