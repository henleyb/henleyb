### Hi, I'm Henley ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a professional developer based in Manchester, UK.

##### I'm currently looking for a great and collaborative team to write code with. If your team has passion for coding and looks to elevate each other as well as the projects they're working on then I'd like to join you?

##### I work towards improving as a developer every day and have been learning solo for a number of years on and off and through various languages. It's only in the past 3 years that I've really commited to making coding a large part of my life. 

##### I could really benefit from being calibrated by more senior developers and just being around other developers that don't code just for work but really live it too. You'll hopefully be a team with at least one or two devs that go to events and meetups etc off their own backs and also enjoy going out socially sometimes.

##### My main experience is with HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, React, Node, C#, Java, T-SQL. I am focusing on levelling up my HTML, CSS, JS and React at the moment before moving on to others.

##### On the other hand, if you're looking for help with coding then fire me a message.

### What's going on?
