### Hi, I'm Henley ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a professional developer based in Manchester, UK.

##### I'm looking for a cool and collaborative team to write code with. If your team has passion for coding and looks to elevate each other as well as the projects they're working on then I'd love to join you.

##### I have been learning coding solo for a number of years on and off and through various languages. It's only in the last 3 or so years that I've really commited to making coding a larger part of my life after realising that I didn't want to be a professional photographer when I was 50. I'd rather be sitting with a cup of coffee in a comfy chair than doing 14 hour days in the rain with a load of camera gear.  

##### I could benefit from being around more seasoned developers who also have a love for code. You'll hopefully be a team with at least one or two devs that go to events and meetups and also enjoy going out socially as a team.

##### My main experience is with HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, React, Node, C#, Java, T-SQL. I am focusing on levelling up my HTML, CSS, JS and React at the moment before moving on to others.

##### On the other hand, if you're looking for help with coding then fire me a message as I'm open to mentoring too.

### What's going on?
