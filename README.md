### Hi, I'm Henley ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a React coffee :coffee: app which is private for the time being but may become public in the future for others to contribute to.
- ðŸ‘¯ This year I will be contributing to some open source projects, I'm looking for something that contributes to helping others on some level - wether that's human, animal or all of us by being for the environment.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by firing me an email, I'm always up for chatting ideas and code.
