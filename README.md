### Hi, I'm Henley ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a professional developer based in Manchester, UK. 

# I'm currently looking for a great team to make cool stuff with. If your team has passion for coding and looks to elevate each other as well as the projects they're working on then please can I join you? 

# I am working towards becoming a better coder every day, I have been learning solo for a number of years and through various languages. I've picked up a lot of knowledge but also don't know what I don't know.

# My main experience is with the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, C#, Java, Ojective-C, T-SQL.

-  :coffee: Iâ€™m currently working on a React coffee app which is private for the time being but may become public in the future for others to contribute to.
- ðŸ‘¯ This year I will be contributing to some open source projects, something that contributes to helping others on some level - that may be human, animal or everything by being for the environment.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by firing me an email, I'm always up for chatting ideas and code.
